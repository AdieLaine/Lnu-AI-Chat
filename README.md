**Lnu-AI Chat** is a conversational AI system that can be used to chat with an AI system that is trained on the Mi'kmaq language and aligned as an Indigenous AI aligned assistant. This system was pre-trained on a large dataset of written and audion translations of Mi'kmaq words and phrases.

**Lnu-AI Chat** has learned the nuances of the Mi'kmaq language structure, including its orthography and written form.


**Pre-Trained**:
- 8000+ Mi'kmaq Words
- 6000+ Audio Translations
- 150000 Prompt Completion Pairs
- OpenAI Fine-Tune Models



**Output**:
- Embedded Mi'kmaq Language Corpus
- Indigenous Aligned AI Assistant
- Translation and Interpretation into 161 Languages
- Logical Reasoning and Problem Solving
- Storytelling and Poetry
- Coding and Programming

## <span style="color: white;">Acknowledgements</span>
The Lnu-AI project honors the timeless art of storytelling, keeping the flame of tradition alive and preserving the rhythmic beauty of Mi'kmaq words. Lnu-AI is my heartfelt gift to the Mi'kmaq people, a testament to our shared heritage, and a vital step towards a future where technology and tradition intersect gracefully, celebrating and honoring the richness of cultural diversity.

We would like to acknowledge [Mi'gmaq-Mi'kmaq Online](https://mikmaqonline.org/) for consolidating Listuguj Mi'kmaq translations.

Lnu-AI was born at the crossroads of GPT-4 API and the insatiable curiosity to be creative. We extend out thanks to[OpenAI](https://openai.com/) for providing the API solution that was critical in the pre-training and fine-tune process.
